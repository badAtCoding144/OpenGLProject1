This is a repo that has examples and demos of how to implement a few CG techniques using OpenGL and C++, it wont work if you pull the repo because I have a bunch of dll's in here and you need assimp (for loading .obj), glfw (for windowing and inputs) and freetype for UI examples. Most of the code in here is from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/)
Honestly there are so many copies of the same files and other unnecessary things in here but it was more of a practice excercise to learn how rendering works so I can eventually learn to use Vulkan.
